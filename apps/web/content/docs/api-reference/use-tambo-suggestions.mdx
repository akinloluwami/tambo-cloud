description: Manage AI-generated suggestions for the next user message.

`useTamboSuggestions` provides a simple API for surfacing and accepting
next-action suggestions generated by Tambo.

```tsx title="Suggestions.tsx"
const {
  suggestions,
  selectedSuggestionId,
  accept,
  generateResult,
  isPending,
} = useTamboSuggestions();
```

## Workflow

1. Call `accept(id)` to copy a suggestion into the input (and optionally submit).
2. Call `generate()` (wrapper provided via `generateResult.mutate()`) to fetch
   fresh suggestions.

## Flags

- **acceptResult / generateResult** – mutation objects from React Query.
- **isPending / isSuccess / isError / error** – derived convenience booleans.
