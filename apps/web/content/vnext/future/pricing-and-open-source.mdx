## Open Source Philosophy

At Tambo, we believe in the power of open source software. Our front-end library is entirely open source and free for everyone to use, modify, and contribute to.

## Future Plans

We are committed to making Tambo as accessible as possible. Our goal is to provide a fully open source solution that anyone can deploy and run on their own infrastructure.

Until we complete the open source version of our server, we're offering our hosted service for free or at cost to support the community.
