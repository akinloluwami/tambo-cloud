# Building our assistant with Tambo + Inkeep MCP Server

At tambo, we like to use our own stuff. When we needed a smarter way for people to get help on our platform, we didn't want a casual chatbot where people would just get stuck in a loop of automated responses—so we just wired up our tambo chat with Inkeep's tambo docs MCP server. The result: a doc-aware AI assistant that lives right on our landing page and dashboard.

## The Problem

People needed a simple way to:

- figure out project configs
- generate/manage API keys
- set up LLM providers + instructions
- add MCP servers
- handle OAuth/security stuff

Instead of long docs or clunky search, we thought: why not just chat with the platform?

## The Fix: tambo + Inkeep MCP

We mashed two things together:

- **tambo** → our generative UI framework that returns React components you can actually use alongside text.
- **Inkeep MCP Server** → a docs MCP server for tambo that makes sure the assistant actually knows our docs and gives relevant answers.

## Meet `ChatWithTambo`

We built a custom tambo chat instance using our own ui components for our platform.

### Components

Users don't just get text—they can actually click/use stuff in chat:

```typescript
export const tamboRegisteredComponents = [
  { name: "ProjectTable", component: ProjectTable },
  { name: "APIKeyList", component: APIKeyList },
  { name: "AvailableMcpServers", component: AvailableMcpServers },
  // ...more
];
```

### Tools

The AI can trigger real actions, not just show info:

```typescript
registerTool({
  name: "generateProjectApiKey",
  tool: async (projectId, name) => {
    // Generate a new API key for the project
    const result = await generateApiKey(projectId, name);

    // Refresh the UI to show the new key
    await refreshApiKeys(projectId);

    return result;
  },
});
```

## How It Plays Out

Say you ask: _"How do I create an API key?"_

1. Chat gets your question
2. MCP server pulls the right doc info
3. AI mixes docs + your real project data
4. Generates an interactive `APIKeyList` component
5. You click, done—API key created right in chat

## The Setup

**Server-Side (Inkeep MCP Server):**

- Runs independently on Inkeep's infrastructure
- Registed on the tambo dashboard on the server side

**Client-Side (Your Tambo App):**

- Components and tools are registered locally
- They are then passed to tambo using `TamboProvider`

The setup is surprisingly simple - you just wrap your app with the providers. tambo handles all the communication between your local tools and the remote MCP server automatically.

## UX Stuff

- Floating chat bubble (full-screen on mobile, panel on desktop)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Handles auth flows without breaking a sweat
- Smart suggestions: "getting started" for newbies, project-specific tips for logged-in users

## What Changed

**For users:** faster answers, interactive help, less confusion.

**For us:** fewer tickets, more self-service, better analytics.

**For the platform:** real showcase of what tambo can do.

## What We Learned

- Server-side MCP > client-side for speed + security
- Docs + interactive components = killer combo
- Auth context makes the chat way more useful
- Tools matter as much as answers—people want to _do_ things
